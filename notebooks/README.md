# Outreach/Teaching notebooks

This folders contains 2 notebooks that were created to introduce the concpets of galactic morphology, and using these morphological measurments to find "interesting" galaxies.

The notebooks assume some familiairty with Python and several common Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

### Notebook 1

The first notebook provides an introduction to the data, and the morphological measurments asymmetry (A), and shape asymmetry (As).
This notebooks also introduces 2 key concepts in Big Data, that of taking the code to the data, and parallelisation.

### Notebook 2

The second notebook expands upon using A, and As to find "interesting" galaxies.

## Installation/Running Instructions

These notebooks were designed to run on the [SciServer](https://www.sciserver.org/) enviroment.
This [link](https://github.com/lewisfish/PawlikMorph-LSST/blob/master/notebooks/Registering%20for%20and%20setting%20up%20SciServer.pdf) gives the details on how to sign up and setup the correct enviroment on SciServer in order to run these notebooks.

## Requirements

The notebooks make use of the PawlikMorph-LSST code as well as the following dependancies:

 - tqdm
 - SciServer
 - IPython

Please see the Readme at the root of this repo for the dependancies required by PawlikMorph-LSST.
